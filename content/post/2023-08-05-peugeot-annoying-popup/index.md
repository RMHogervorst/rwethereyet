 I have a car, it's a nice car, full electric and it works wonderfully. But recently
 peugeot has done the most annoying thing I have ever seen.
 
 **Fucking popups in the car, while driving!** With nasty dark UI patterns.
 
 Here is what happens:
 While driving (in the first 10 minutes or so) the screen in the car is filled
 completely with essentially a commercial message about all of the cool features
 you can enable in your car. 
 
 The screen pops up over any screen you had previously, whether navigating with 
 the build in navigation system, google carplay, or playing music. Any screen.
 
 The screen has 2 options: one big OK button, and a small arrow pointing left.
 
 You would think that 'OK' means you read the message and want to continue navigating
 or other important tasks **WHILE DRIVING** but no, that will navigate you directly
 towards an obscure menu with other 'cool' features you can enable, on your phone
 or somewhere else, NOT from the car. You have to press 3 or 4 buttons to get back
 to what you were doing before, e.g. DRIVING a 1500kg car. 
 
 The back button does allow you to get back to what you were doing, or if you
 wait for a few seconds the screen goes away.
 
 So my main gripes:
 - unblockable pop ups
 - WHILE DOING IMPORTANT SHIT
 - dark UI pattern that forces you to a screen that you can do nothing with
 
 
 IS this the new normal? You don't own your system and are forced to watch ads while driving?
