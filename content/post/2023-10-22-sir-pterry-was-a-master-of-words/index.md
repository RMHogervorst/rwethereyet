I'm slowly going through some highlights I made in 2017 ( I discovered the 
text file of highlights exported from my old kindle ebook reader a few weeks
back in my archive). I love the watch series more than anything from the discworld
books, but the Rincewind series has amazing quotes too. Here are some highlights
from Eric (Rincewind # 4)


> It is well known that eight colors make up white. But there are also eight colors of blackness, for those that have the seeing of them, and the hives of Death are among the black grass in the black orchard under the black-blossomed, ancient boughs of trees that will, eventually, produce apples that…put it like this…probably won’t be red. --p2 

(the buildup, it is just lovely!
Interestingly there are black apples among the 5000 cultivars of apples that we 
have today!)


> Interestingly enough, the gods of the Disc have never bothered much about judging the souls of the dead, and so people only go to hell if that’s where they believe, in their deepest heart, that they deserve to go. Which they won’t do if they don’t know about it. This explains why it is important to shoot missionaries on sight. p125


> The Tezuman Empire in the jungle valleys of central Klatch is known for its organic market gardens, its exquisite craftsmanship in obsidian, feathers and jade, and its mass human sacrifices in honor of Quezovercoatl, the Feathered Boa, god of mass human sacrifices. As they said, you always knew where you stood with Quezovercoatl. It was generally with a lot of people on top of a great stepped pyramid with someone in an elegant feathered headdress chipping an exquisite obsidian knife for your very own personal use. The Tezumen are renowned on the continent for being the most suicidally gloomy, irritable and pessimistic people you could ever hope to meet, for reasons that may soon be made clear. It was true about the time measurement as well. The Tezumen had realized long ago that everything was steadily getting worse and, having a terrible literal-mindedness, had developed a complex system to keep track of how much worse each succeeding day was. p34

This is just a beautiful mix of everything we know about the Aztec people.
Just look at that beautiful bastardization of 'Quetzalcoatl' to 'Quezovercoatl'!
