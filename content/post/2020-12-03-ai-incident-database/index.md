I found this database of AI incidents. 
Do notice that there is nothing like intelligence here. It is just dump
humans, misapplying technology and not taking responsibility.

But I really applaud this overview! At the moment I created this post there were 1175 reports about AI incidents. And you can use the database to research your problem area to make sure you are not doing the same stupid thing! Progress! This is how the Aviation Industry improves their planes, by learning from mistakes. This is why the Health industry is making such a slow progress, lessons learned in one place are not applied to other places.

> The Discover app is intended for users that need to discover whether their intelligent system or problem area has previously produced incidents in the real world.
