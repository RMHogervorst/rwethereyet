I have an older kobo device that is perfectly fine for reading epubs, but it
does not perform that well anymore.
I dislike some of the features of the kobo reader, 
their push for their cloud things, and that I cannot turn off the branding[^1].

But overall it is a nice piece of hardware, easy to put into a pocket[^2] or bag, I can send my books with an usb cable to the device.
I don't know if the software was always slow, or if updates have slowed it down,
but kobo seems to struggle with larger files. 

I recently bought a massive book (1329 pages). It does not open on the device.

But the open source community has created awesome alternative readers that run on
existing devices. I have installed plato. Plato is a sort of app on top of kobo 
(I don't really understand how it works). 
But it is really fast and it opens massive books easily. It is just a beautiful piece of work!

Fonts are very legible, it is fast, it just works.[^3]

[^1]: Upon review, it seems I can turn it off. edit the line affiliate into 'affiliate=Kobo' in .kobo/affiliate.conf. 
[^2]: Male jeans pockets only of course, [women are not allowed to have functional pockets in their trousers](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/ "the pudding's absolutely beautiful explainer.").
[^3]: Plato has many many (too many) swipe gestures, taps and thingies, I only ever tap the sides to move to the next page, not sure if I can turn everything else off?
