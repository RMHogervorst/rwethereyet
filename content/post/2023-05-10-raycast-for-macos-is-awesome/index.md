Raycast is an amazing launcher replacement for the default Macos launchpad. Raycast is fast, and has many plugins.

But I love it best for all the simple things it adds to my mac:
the ability to move windows without using a mouse (left half, left third, next monitor, etc). There is a ton of functionality that will probably increase my productivity but I haven't found yet.
