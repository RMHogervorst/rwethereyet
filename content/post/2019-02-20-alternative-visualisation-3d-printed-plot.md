Joachim Gassen ([twitter](https://twitter.com/JoachimGassen)) tweeted last year:

> #3Dprinting data with #rayshader. First time I have something in my hand that is made entirely out of data and R. Thanks to @tylermorganwall and the #rstats community for making this happen! Blog post: https://bit.ly/2BvVKlX

They use the package rayshader to create the 3d representation that is converted
to STL which can be used in his 3d printer's software.
