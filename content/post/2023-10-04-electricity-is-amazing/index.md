It is amazing I live in country where there is electricity out of all the outlets
in house. That it stays very close to 250 Volts and 50Hz. That power is generated
out of a diverse set of sources (solar, wind, gas...). 

There are lines, buried in the ground, connecting my house to the 
neighborhood's grid and there are higher voltage buried lines connecting the 
neighborhood to the city grid. And finally there are power lines connecting
my city to the power producers. 

Infrastructure is more than just the pipelines connecting supply and demand. I
think all the regulations around it are part of it too. 
There are certifications for tradespeople who work on electricity.
There are rules for setting up electricity lines, there are audits. 

It is a system for a vital part of society. 

_There is also a huge system of buying and selling electricity but let's not get into that right now._
