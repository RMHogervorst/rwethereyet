I just read this interesting post by Anne-Laure Le Cunff: [building an anti-library](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary).  The idea is that unread books can be as powerful as read books, maybe even more powerful. 

> The goal of an antilibrary is not to collect books you have read so you can proudly display them on your shelf; instead, it is to curate a highly personal collection of resources around themes you are curious about. Instead of a celebration of everything you know, an antilibrary is an ode to everything you want to explore.


Some great tips in that post:

* while reading something, collect references to things that piques your interest. 
* ask other readers of something you read for recommondations. (I see a lot of that on reddit)
