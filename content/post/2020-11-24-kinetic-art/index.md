I found this tumblr filled with videos of kinetic art.
And I love that! Maybe that is why I love Simone Giertz' work so much
there is a beauty in creating mechanical devices. 
Here you find a movie of ten kinetic sculptures:

In 2019 I visited the exhibition 'Action Reaction' in  'De kunsthal' in Rotterdam.

![Hans Haacke, Blaues Segel, 1964-1965, Collection FRAC Grand Large â€“ Hauts-de-France, Dunkerque, Photo Wolfgang Neeb](hans_haacke_blaues_segel_1964-1965.jpg.)

[Check the page here](https://www.kunsthal.nl/en/plan-your-visit/exhibitions/action-reaction/) and also check the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBLQcDdj7oA) embedded in the page.

It was such a wonder to walk through the museum and see these sculptures that either moved or pretended to move. Such an eye for detail. I love it.
