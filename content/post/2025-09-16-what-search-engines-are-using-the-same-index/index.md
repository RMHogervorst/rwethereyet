Found a few pages about search engines, you  might like these as well:

Search engine map displays the largest English language search pages: 

<https://www.searchenginemap.com/>

It is inspired by [the map of the internet](https://internet-map.net/) and displays
search engines and their indexes. Because only a few search engines crawl the web
themselves. Most use other indexes. 

The largest are Google and Bing (for example duckduckgo and ecosia use bing as their
index).

Seirdy describes all the search engines they could find with indexes.
I have used Google of course, but also [stract](https://stract.com/) and [marginalia](https://marginalia-search.com/)

Stract finds this blog, marginalia does not.

Enjoy!
