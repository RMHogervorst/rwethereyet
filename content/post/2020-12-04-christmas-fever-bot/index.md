Last year hackaday found this [project](https://hackaday.com/2019/12/24/tiny-tree-is-a-thermometer-for-christmas-fever/).
They always have the most amazing finds. The post links to a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdYQyiK1drk) by '8 bits and a byte' 

![still from the video](/2020-12-04-christmas-fever-bot/index_files/Screenshot 2020-04-25 at 18.47.28.png)

It is a bot that checks google trends for the popularity of the word 'Christmas'. That popularity is used to drive the leds in this small christmas tree. More popular, is more bright!
