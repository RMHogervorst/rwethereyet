In this quick post I'd like to point your attention to [standard ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/). They create beautiful e-books from open 
sources such as project Gutenberg. If you ever tried books from project 
Gutenberg on your e-reader, you have seen remarkable differences in quality,
this project makes it their goal to create beautiful good quality versions: 

> Standard Ebooks is a volunteer driven, not-for-profit project that produces new editions of public domain ebooks that are lovingly formatted, open source, and free.

> Ebook projects like Project Gutenberg transcribe ebooks and make them available for the widest number of reading devices. Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology.

So go to <https://standardebooks.org/> and see if you can help them out, and 
why not try the following books which I am currently reading: [medititations - Marcus Aurelius](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/marcus-aurelius/meditations/george-long)
or [Discources - Epictetus](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/discourses/george-long). Have fun!
