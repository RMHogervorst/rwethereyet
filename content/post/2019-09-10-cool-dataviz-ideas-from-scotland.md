I was in Scotland recently and in the Glasgow
university Museum (the Hunterian) I found an amazing visualisation from 1848

This is literally a 3d model, created by James Thomson the brother of [Lord Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin). From the sign in the museum: This is a visualisation of a mathematic model that shows the link between pressure and freezing point for carbonic acid and is based on measured data.

In the library of Edinburgh I found a nice overview of the length of rivers in Scotland. The rivers are visualised next to each other and in a more or less straight line.

- There are [many charts of river length it seems](http://theswedishparrot.com/la-hauteur-des-montagnes-la-longueur-des-rivieres/ "french website that talks about this, I think")
