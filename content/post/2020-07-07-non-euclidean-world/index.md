I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8&feature=youtu.be) where someone created a rendering machine to display non-euclidean spaces. He walks around in really really weird places. Like: a building that seems to have 4 rooms, but when you walk in it, there are only 3, or 5. I cannot express how much of a brain f*ck this project is. It is fascinating to watch.

>Here's a demo of a rendering engine I've been working on that allows for non-euclidean worlds.

As someone commented under the youtube video:  '"I couldn't do it in Unity so I had to make my own engine." Ah yes the simplest solution '
