This is a beautiful build of a simple box with a timer <https://www.digitaljunky.io/the-anti-procrastination-box/> 
that helps you lock away your phone so you don't distract yourself

Maybe I should do something with that arduino I have lying around, 
but maybe not before I do all my other tasks....
