Maarten Lambrechts has a huge collection of weird graphics which he calls *Xeno graphics*

>Xeno.graphics is a collection of unusual charts and maps, managed by Maarten Lambrechts. Its objective is to create a repository of novel, innovative and experimental visualizations to inspire you, to fight xenographphobia and popularize new chart types.

For example: Maptrix

>Like origin-destination maps, MapTrix overcomes the clutter associated with a traditional flow map while providing geographic embedding that is missingin standard OD matrix representations.
