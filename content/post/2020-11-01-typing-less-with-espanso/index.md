I have been typing a lot lately in my zettelkasten. 
and that made me think about improving my typing by using some sort of text expanding device. 
I have several devices that I want to work equivalently
I have a linux laptop, a macbook, and for $work I have to use  a windows laptop. There are not many programs that work across all of those devices. I'm now trying out [espanso](https://espanso.org/) which seems to work everywhere (mac, linux, windows)! I want to define the words in one place and sync over devices. 


Espanse is not on android yet, but I feel typing on android needs something different.


### This is just a rough outline

some handy markdown things

- markdown link :mdl
`[]()`
- markdown image :mdi
`![]`

- markdown table :mdt


### Words I often use
- machine learning, knowledge graph

### What doesn't work 
It seems Rstudio blocks pasting, or at least the results are only half. when it type `:mdl` it only pastes `[](`
