Julian Lehr [(@lehrjulian)](https://twitter.com/lehrjulian) [writes about
how social networks are used as signaling](https://julian.digital/2020/08/06/proof-of-x/); as a proof of work.

> I’m not talking about consensus algorithms like the ones that some crypto currencies use. I’m talking about social networks.
> At their core, social networks are primarily about one thing: Building social capital through signaling.

> For example: A Patagonia vest signals both a prosocial attitude (“I care about the environment“) as well as wealth (“I can afford to spend $500 on a jacket“).

The post goes pretty deep into what a typical travel picture on instagram can signal. 

> Instagram is essentially “pics or it didn’t happen”-as-a-service.

> Strava, on the other hand, introduced an entirely new proof mechanism: Proof-of-physical-activity.

> What other social networks should we build that could have similar positive feedback loops? And what are their proof mechanisms?

In [his tweet for comments](https://twitter.com/lehrjulian/status/1291397928788135942) we see a lot of ideas: a social network for philantropy, 
a podcast listening tracking app. 

So what does a personal programming blog signal? 
I think it signals communication skills and proof you can work with 
several techniques. Is there specific signaling for data science?
