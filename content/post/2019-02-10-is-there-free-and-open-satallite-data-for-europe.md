This package came out for landsat (rLandsat): 
<https://blog.socialcops.com/technology/data-science/announcing-rlandsat-landsat-8-data/>

It gives you access to satallite data in diferent spectra. 

As far as I know, this is only United States data, I wonder if there is something
like that for the Netherlands and the rest of Europe?

-update: yes, yes there is! <https://www.spaceoffice.nl/nl/satellietdataportaal/> (dutch)

gives you access to preconfigured images or raw sentinel, radarsat, triplesat,
planetscope, rapideye, SPOT6/7 Fomosat-2 DMC (I don't know what any of these are, but it sounds cool)


But I don't think there are packages for that yet
