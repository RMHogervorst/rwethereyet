I'm using the zettelkasten / slipbox method of taking notes. And I've been doing that since a few months. That also means I classify all my reading into either reading for learning or reading for
pleasure. In a way it has given me te freedom to really enjoy a book or blogpost but when it is 
not for pleasure I need to take notes. And those notes need to be processed. 

And that blocks me sometimes. I have a ton of books that I decided I need to process and not just
read for pleasure. But I want to finish the other books first. 

So what is on my to process list:

- Every tool is a hammer by Adam Savage
- The uninhabitable earth
- Designing your life
- Systems Thinking

But for pleasure I keep returning to book series I've read multiple times

- The watch series in disk world - Terry Pratchett 
- The Frontiers Saga (part 2) - Ryk Brown
- The Expanse series - James S.A. Corey


So I don't know if this strict distinction between the types of books helps. It might 
prevent me from starting books that are only tangentially useful...

On the other hand, maybe I shouldn't stop myself from starting in new books, I can always keep
the notes separate and process them whenever I can.
