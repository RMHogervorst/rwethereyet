Some websites I visit, use trust arc to push you to accept cookies.  It feels like a deliberate attempt to make the experience worse.
The system loads very slowly, and after you have told them you do not want any of their 3000 vendor's cookies. it takes up to 10 seconds to 'save the changes'.


And you know what, I'm not the only one look at these reviews on trustpilot: <https://ie.trustpilot.com/review/trustarc.com>

> ## Pretty unethical - sleep scripts and dark patterns
> Pretty unethical use of sleep scripts to slow down accessing a website when you consciously decline cookies, and the use of dark patterns to try and encourage users to click "Cancel" while a sleep script is running is pretty awful too. Do better, please. **Date of experience:** 25 January 2025

> Dark Patterns  
> Intentionally slow down process of declining cookies. **Date of experience:** 26 February 2024

>## Scumbag Company
>TrustArc make money from making it as difficult as possible for website users to reject cookies and arguably are in breach of privacy laws. Scumbag company.  **Date of experience:** 16 July 2023
