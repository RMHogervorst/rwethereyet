This has nothing to do with R, but man, this is awesome! 
Techcrunch [has an article about a company that uses drones to plant seeds](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/26/that-night-a-forest-flew-droneseed-is-planting-trees-from-the-air/)

The article goes into some depth to explain why they reseed after a forest fire
and how difficult is was to make the drones work reliable. 

- They scout and map the area from the air
- they spray the ground, from the air, with herbicides to prevent weeds
- and seed the new trees
