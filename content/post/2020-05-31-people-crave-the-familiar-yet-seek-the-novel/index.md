subtitle: 'From fidget spinners and big data to data science'

I read 'the creative curve', 
and one of the central points of the book is that people crave things that are like everything they have seen, and yet a bit different. Every new exposure to a thing makes you enjoy it more untill you reach a saturation point and every new exposure after that 'point of cliche' makes you dislike it. 
This happens for every person but also for groups of people. So after a while we (in aggregate) collectively crave a thing and are suddenly done with it.

This explains things like fidget spinners, (me mentioning this shows how out of touch I am with what is popular) they look like other toys to sooth yourself but are slightly different. Hmm maybe this is a bad example, because I'm looking at google trend worldwide and people are still searching for these things, there seems to be a revival in popularity after march 22 2020.

But in the USA popularity is declining:

But it is not just toys. Its also job names and hypes in the techworld. I've noticed that I cringe when someone mentions 'Big Data'. Since I am in the fore front of that field I am already very familiar and seek something new. And maybe the world is too:

For me data science is also becoming cliche, but the worldwide trend has not yet reached its peak.

Of course, a worldwide trend masks the differences per region and smoothes the curve out over a longer period. But some things are truly done and over, and we should be very glad: this is the interest in blockchain:

Though I feel bad for Nigeria, Ghana and China. It seems interest is still high there. Maybe they are still trying to get their money back from scammers?
