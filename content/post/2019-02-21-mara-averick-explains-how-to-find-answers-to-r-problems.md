Mara Averick has a great presentation on how to find answers to 
problems in 'How I found your answer':

- Slides <https://speakerdeck.com/batpigandme/how-i-found-your-answer-dc-r-2018>
- Repo <https://github.com/batpigandme/dcr>

In this presentation Mara talks about how to ask a question online and how to 
use questions to improve your documentation and error messages. 

It also pitches the [reprex package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=reprex)
that helps you create a small, reproducible, and runnable example of code.
