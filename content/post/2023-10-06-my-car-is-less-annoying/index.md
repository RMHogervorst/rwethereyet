In [august I posted about an annoying pop up feature in my car](post/2023/08/05/peugeot-annoying-popup/), but that doesn't happen anymore!
I don't know what they changed, but thank $deity!

I did not complain to them, so maybe someone else did, or it was a bug that was
fixed?

Another interesting thing I recently found: the peugeot android app does not seem to read from the same API that I do.
The android app told me that I drove only 1000 km, but I am way further on mileage, I know the API presents this data too because home-assistant uses that API and tells me my mileage precisely. But for some reason the android app doesn't know, or doesn't read that information. 

Weird.
