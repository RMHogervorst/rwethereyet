On twitter [@kleinmatic](https://twitter.com/kleinmatic "Scott Klein twitter") asks for unconventional vizualisations:

> ðŸ“Š Dataviz Twitter ðŸ“ˆ I'm looking for examples of unconventional viz that "breaks the rules." Pease send me your favorite examples of the avant garde, the upside-down, and the wrong but right. Unexpected successes but also instructive failures. Interactive & static both welcome.

The examples he get's back are amazing!

Here are some, but please go to the thread.
