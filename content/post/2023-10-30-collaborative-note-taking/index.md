Have you ever done collaborative note taking? There are a few versions I have 
seen: 

- **Live editing a document**: The R-Opensci organization creates a document before they livestream  a talk and the organization gives every listener read and write access. This allows everyone in the livestream to raise questions, avoids duplication and allows the presenter to answer questions at the end. 

- **a wiki**: There is wikipedia and other mediawiki tools (..confluence...) that allow anyone to edit and to expand the text, but also link to other related topics.

- **adding comments**: reddit, youtube comments, lobste.rs and ycombinator-hackernews (the yellow site) have the ability to comment and even comment on comments. 

- **writing articles in response**: letters to the editor in scientific journals, blogposts, twitter, mastodon, and even videos create a response that is weakly linked to the original
topic. 

## Gardens and streams
videos, blog posts and comments are like a stream: you step in somewhere and 
have to follow it 'real time'. This is neat, and fast moving, but not necessarily
aimed at getting to the truth. It is also really hard to consolidate information.

Wikis and some websites follow the garden metaphor. We prune information that
is wrong and combine and ingest information from different times to create 
something bigger.
