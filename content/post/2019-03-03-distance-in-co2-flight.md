This is a equidistance [projection](https://notes.rmhogervorst.nl/post/2019/02/14/world-projections-in-ggplot2-examples-by-claus-wilke/ "for how to do this in ggplot2") from the point of origin and tells
you how many kilograms of CO2 you create flying to that destination.

For instance how may kilograms is it to fly to my friend in Salt lake City?
2718 kilograms!
