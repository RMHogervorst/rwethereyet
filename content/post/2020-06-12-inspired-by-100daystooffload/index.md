I wanted to join in on the 100DaysToOffload, a writing challenge to write 100 posts in a year time. So that would mean 2 posts a week. I'm not really getting there, but it goes in bursts. So I didn't do a lot in the past week, but I wrote three posts today, (but I'm planning them in the future [1]). 

Today I scrolled through the [blogroll on 100daystooffload.com](https://100daystooffload.com/blogroll.html) and through the mastodon and twitter feeds and it's so much fun to see posts by complete strangers! 
A lot is by people in the tech space but there are posts about writing, the books they read and sometimes even objects in their house! I have also found creators on twitter that are inspiring, and so I've added them to my inspiring list on twitter. I feel it really shows a completely new site of the internet.

[1]: It is really quite cool, I'm using a static site generator (hugo) and I write my blogposts in markdown (or RMarkdown, converted to markdown) The files live on github and netlify executes hugo, that builds the html. The html is than served by netlify. It normally only builds on a git push, and posts in the future are not build. However, I have a hook through IFTTT that toggles a rebuild of the site 3 times a week. And so future posts will show up, even if I did not push it on that day.
