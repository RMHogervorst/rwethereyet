In an ideal world you communicate with people. Your personal assistent and your contact's
personal assistent negotiate through which channel. Whatsapp, signal, text, email, or 
something else. Your personal assistent knows that @roelMHogervorst on twitter is the 
same person as @rmhogervorst@mastodon.technology on mastodon.

Ideally we instruct our personal assistant to send a message to a person and don't 
care about which medium was used, only if it was private or public.
