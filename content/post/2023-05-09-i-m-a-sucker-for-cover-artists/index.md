Maybe it is because I am in my thirties. But I have bouts of nostalgia for music. And what better way to enjoy that by listing to music that sounds like something you already know!

If you really want that feeling, your best option is listening to the [somaFM channel 'covers'](https://somafm.com/player/#/now-playing/covers "Songs you know, by artists you don't"). 

But if you want some other options, look at the following list:

I put these artists in the order of awesomeness (since I don't have spotify I'll link to youtube)
