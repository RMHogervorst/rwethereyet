I am currently watching 'Travellers' on Netflix and I will not spoil the series
for you but people are being taken over by others. What I really really enjoy
is how actors can play different characters in the same person. No changes on
the outside except how they play it. 

Yesterday I watched one episode where someone played three different persons!
It is amazing. Acting is truly an art. I love it. 

I just love seeing craftsmanship, I enjoy watching woodworking videos, 
everything Adam Savage does and apparently, watching great actors.
