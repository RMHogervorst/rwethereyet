Found this odd visual of pandemics over time.

It is different than anything I have ever seen. I don't think it's easy to compare the 
sizes against each other, but death toll is expressed in numbers too. 
So it sort of shows history by looking back. I don't know. 
The infographic has more when you go to the page and scroll down. 


The article tells you about R0 and spread of diseases over the globe too.
