Over on the rstudio community forums Andrés Castro Socolich explains
how to [get shiny server (AND rstudio server) installed and working on a 
raspberry pi 3](https://community.rstudio.com/t/setting-up-your-own-shiny-server-rstudio-server-on-a-raspberry-pi-3b/18982).

He does not tell us about the performance but:

> Installing rstudio from source on raspbian can take around 12 hours

So.... good luck everyone!
