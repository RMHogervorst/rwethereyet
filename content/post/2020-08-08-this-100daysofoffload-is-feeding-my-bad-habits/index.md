This is post 31 in my 100daysToOffload challenge and I think I need to change
things around. 

## The good 
I really like the challenge, I love reading posts from people
who were complete strangers from me. And more often than not their posts are
very interesting. This challenge has freed me to experiment with writing about
Stoic concepts, and just to write about what is happening around me. 

## The not so good
However, I have a feeling this challenge is also feeding my bad
writing habits. 
My writing has become more sloppy, barely researched and the posts very short.
And frankly of low content. And I'm not taking advantage from my ever growing
zettelkasten ( a note taking technique that connects concepts together). 


# So what should I do? 

- should I write more concept posts in advance and reread later so the quality
improves? 
- Should I do nothing except noting and staying aware?
- Other ideas?
