It seems the linewidth wars are starting up again.

Linus Torvalds [speaks (characteristicly harsh, but not super rude)](https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/5/29/1038) about restricting
your code to a linewidth of 80, he says it is nonsense. 

- basic tools like grep are line based and break if you break your lines
- monitors are wide
- we no longer live in the 80s


It is a small thing of annoyance for me when the python tools like flake8 or black complain about line length of 80. I usually set it to 120.
