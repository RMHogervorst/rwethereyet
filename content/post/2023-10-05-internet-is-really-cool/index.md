I'm writing this piece[^1] at home. My 
home has a stable fiber connection to a neighborhood point and that point is
connected to the wider internet. 

I make use of several 'free'[^2] services:
- github: hosts my code (and triggers)
- netlify: builds my hugo site and publishes it

And several services I pay for:
- I pay for a domain name that redirects the easily readable name notes.rmhogervorst.nl to the ip adress where the data lives.
- internet service to my home


Everyone in the whole wide world can connect to the website and read it[^3].

[^1]: in an Rstudio editor for some reason. 
[^2]: Who pays for this? is an important question that I am dodging because I want to write positive things for a while.
[^3]: In theory, because you must be able to read English (or have a translation in your language), and if your access is not blocked (which happens a lot)
