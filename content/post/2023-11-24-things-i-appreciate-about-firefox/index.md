Just a quick appreciation post about firefox, now that it becomes clear that
google is pushing for chrome everywhere and making youtube videos load slowly on purpose 
on firefox, it is clear we need that other browser. 

I have a firefox account and am logged in on my mobile phone, and on the browsers
on my laptops. I can send browsertabs from my phone to my machines and back,
this is such a killer feature! I love it so much!

I can also search through all my history over all my machines! 


The other thing I really like about firefox is the rich ecosystem of addons,
I'm not using many of them, but there are addblockers, color changers, language packs and more.
