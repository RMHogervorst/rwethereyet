I've never really tracked what I read. Not seriously anyways.
I once had goodreads account (in 2014!), but goodreads became enslaved by Amazon and so we shouldn't touch it anymore. 

But this year I'm giving tracking a serious go. 

I've added two new columns to calibre: 'started reading' 'stopped reading' so
I can keep track in my own system. 
I'm also keeping track on a bookwyrm instance called [rambling-readers](https://ramblingreaders.org/user/rmhogervorst). 

Bookwyrm uses the activitypub system so people all acros the fediverse can interact
with bookwyrm users. This is an interesting idea and I love the idea of book communities.


There have been other ideas about sharing your library of books, and your reading
progress with others. I like [Tom Critchlow's wiki of books](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/books/)
He even proposed a [library.json format for books](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/04/15/library-json/)

His idea was to inspire each other by displaying what you're reading:

> Would love to see a "web of books" emerge from the web rather than via fixing goodreads --tomcritchlow (sep 7, 2019)

But there is already a spec (Open Publication Distribution System) https://opds.io/index.html

OOh it seems there are [plugins](https://github.com/steinarb/opds-reader) for calibre to transform your library into a opds format. There is a better one too: [COPS (Calibre OPDS (and HTML) PHP Server)](https://github.com/seblucas/cops)


So I'm tracking my reading in two places and sharing it online too.
I love the simple goal I set at the start of the year: read 20 books.

Tracking just for tracking is a stupid idea, see [my earlier post "collecting just for the sake of collecting"](https://notes.rmhogervorst.nl/post/2021/03/22/collecting-just-for-the-sake-of-collecting/).
it should make sense, there should be a motivation to track information. In this case, I want to read back what I read in this year and want to see how many books I can read. And to motivate me to read books in stead of scrolling through my phone.


Anyway what I want most, I think, is to organize my digital library and make it easy to search through all my books.


_Good thing I checked my goodreads account, it was still active! at least they allow me to download a copy of the data and I removed the account._
