I would love it if my personal assistent could read and select news for me. 
It would browse all the RSS feeds I follow, the reddit subs, newsletters and pick the ones I find
interesting and visualize them all in one screen for me. It should also discard everything I don't 
find interesting. 
With news I don't mean the headlines of what is going on in the world: more covid deaths in brazil for instance, but mean things like newest packages in data science world. New feature engineering tricks, new algorithms etc. 

Because the assistent works for me, not a corperation, it can learn from me. 
And because it works for me, and not for the profit of marketeers I can be honest and
say I like or dislike articles. Maybe we can add a tldr algorithm on it to summarize articles and
relevant keywords.
