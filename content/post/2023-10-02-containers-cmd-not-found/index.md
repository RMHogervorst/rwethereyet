Running a container in kubernetes is sometimes annoyingly difficult.
Especially if the feedbackloop is long, when you only get a failing container
notification.


Here is one I had recently:

`OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: (...) executable file not found in $PATH": unknown`

I knew the container had the thing, so what on earth is going wrong?

In a manifest for kubernetes (deployments/statefulsets etc.) you must specify
a container (of course) but you can also supply a `cmd` and or `args`.

The container that I started already executed a command on start, but by supplying the command
with cmd, the system could not find that part. 

It took me 2 hours but finally it dawned  on me: supply the things in `args`.

Now it just runs.
