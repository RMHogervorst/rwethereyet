Heard on Data Stories 138:
**Turning data into sound**

In this episode of data stories an interview with Hannah Davis, who creates
music from data. Not just turning datapoints into audio features (pitch, type 
of instrument, tempo) but truly music. 

Hannah takes positivity negativity, type of words and a transformation of words
into emotions to translate into music:
> The musical piece chronologically follows the novel. It uses the text data to determine the tempo, key, notes, octaves, etc. for the piece. 
 
A beautiful example is here https://soundcloud.com/transprose/peter-pan

Made me think of the wonderful work of [Thomas Levine](https://thomaslevine.com/data-music/ "his certificate is broken")
