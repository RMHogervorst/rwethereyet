At $work we have a kubernetes[^1] cluster. I have to tell every deployment
how many resources we need, if you go over a certain threshold the deployment
is refused. 

I wanted half a CPU (500 millicpu) but my deployment was refused: "You are not 
allowed to claim 500.000 cpus". 

You know why?

- I claimed "500M" in stead of "500m"

I wonder if that is ever needed?



[^1]: I heard someone call it 'kates,' based on the k8s acronym I guess?
