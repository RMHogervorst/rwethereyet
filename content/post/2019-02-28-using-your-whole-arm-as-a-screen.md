According to [Jean-Baptiste Lefevre](https://twitter.com/jblefevre60/status/1060898805552504833)
the Lumiwatch, better article [here](https://www.cnet.com/news/lumiwatch-projector-smartwatch-turns-your-arm-into-a-touchscreen/)
can turn your arm into a touch screen. 

But the videos seem to be better than the real product so far...
