I'm slowly going through some highlights I made in 2017 ( I discovered the 
text file of highlights exported from my old kindle ebook reader a few weeks
back in my archive). I love the watch series more than anything from the discworld
books, but the Rincewind series has amazing quotes too. Here are some highlights
from 'Interesting Times'

> *People are always a little confused about this, as they are in the case of miracles. When someone is saved from certain death by a strange concatenation of circumstances, they say that’s a miracle. But of course if someone is killed by a freak chain of events—the oil spilled just there, the safety fence broken just there—that must also be a miracle. Just because it’s not nice doesn’t mean it’s not miraculous. p 316 Interesting Times

(beautiful description of change and how we percieve it)

 
> Once again a foot kicked Rincewind in the kidneys, making its usual explicit request in the Esperanto of brutality. p 148 Interesting Times

You could have said universal language, but this is so much better!
