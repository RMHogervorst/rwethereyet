So I heard this on [data stories](http://datastori.es/simulated-dendrochronology-of-u-s-immigration-with-pedro-cruz-and-john-wihbey/),
Pedro Cruz and John Wihbey created a visualisation of population growth by seeing it as a tree.

> "A beautiful display of how a country grows"


The project is [here](http://pmcruz.com/dendrochronology/).

The metaphor is so nice: everyone remains part of the history of the country.


Look at it! It's soo pretty!
