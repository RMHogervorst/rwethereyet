Found this Nightingale (The Journal of the Data Visualization Society) post:
[The Hungarian Statistician Behind Three Volumes of Visualization Masterpieces](https://medium.com/nightingale/the-hungarian-statistician-behind-three-volumes-of-visualization-masterpieces-801a1d3e9705)

It is about the work of Hungarian statistician Lajos Illyefalvi (1881–1944).

About one of the titles 'Past and Present':

> Past and Present wasn’t inventive, wasn’t progressive, and wasn’t original, but used a wide range of chart types professionally and perfectly. Some of the dashboard-like pages are really beautiful, and few graphic types were introduced first in these volumes for the Hungarian public.


Look at these examples from the post:
